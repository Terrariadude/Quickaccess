# Quickaccess
Annoyed by how long it takes to type in a search result to get to a site? Spent hours searching through your applications for
the right one? Quickaccess is what you need! Simply download the file, then, type in the URL of the site. If you want to add
an application, simply click or tap 'add application'. It will come up with a textbox allowing you to insert the name of an 
app. But wait! There's more! You can call or message anyone by clicking or tapping 'contacts' and adding their phone number. 
Then, select the number and choose either 'call' or 'message'. Message allows you to type in a message and send it, while call
is your average call session.

So, what are you waiting for? Try Quickaccess today!
